I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heartbeat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again
You got me in love again

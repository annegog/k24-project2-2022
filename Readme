- server_
    *dataServer:
        - communication_thread: reads the path/directory (I have a prob here so I recommend to put the folder .server_folder) from the client. For every regural file in the directory calls the place_the_files function
        - worker_thread: waiting for a signal. If the queue is full and there are more files remain to read, calls the obtain function. And then, 
            the worker thread calls send_d func.
    *server.h:
        - place: place a file in the queue. If the queue is full is waiting for a signal and give the signal to the worker thread so can pop a 
            file from the queue.
        - obtain: if the queue is empty is waiting for the communication thread. Else is poping a file.
        - find_num_of_files: opening the directory we want to process and counting the files.
        - place_the_files: is also opening the directory and for every file calls the place function.
         - send_d: sending the namefile and the length of that to the client. !!! He does not send the data of the file!!!!

- client_
    *remoteClient: Sending the directory name that he wants to copy. Taking from the server the name of every file. Making a file and writes a messege "hi" cause I didn't make it!!!!!

-------------------------------------------------------------
* Further observations *
- I'm using code from the slides!
- Put the args you want in the Makefiles. (I have an example)
------------------------------------------------------------------
**Sum up: server is just reading the file and give to the client the namefile. I CAN'T MAKE IT TO SEND THE DATA !!! :( 
    I'M NOT SO GOOD AT THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
